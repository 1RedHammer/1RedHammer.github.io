            <p><span class = "MINECRAFT">Minecraft</span> is a fun game where you mine, craft, build, slaughter, and use your brain. It's the most played
                video game, ever. Buy it on amazon or something, and play! To move, use WASD. To mine, hold left-click. To 
                place a block, select it using keys 1-9, and right-click to place it. To open doors, trapdoors, fill a bucket,
                untie a leash, tie a leash, and others, right-click. In fact, right-click is for most actions. To craft, open a chest,
                and even cook stuff in your furnace. Anyway, e to open your inventory, click, and click again to move things, and use ctrl+q to drop things.
                T to open chat, where you chat with everybody else in your server. The goal of the game (in survival mode) is to defeat 
                the Ender Dragon, who's probably the worst boss ever (it has no phases), but is still a real challenge. You have to 
                travel to the Nether(make a portal to the nether by making a rectangular shape with 
                obsidian, leaving the inside blank. The frame can be anywhere from 4x5 to 23x23 blocks in size. 
                Then, summon lightning inside of it using flint and steel, and boom. There's a portal.)
                , and find it. Yeah. Mine, craft, build, and fight your way to victory!!!!!!!!!

        <h2 id = "mining-heading">MINING TECHNIQUES</h2>
        <div id = "mining-paragraphs">
            <p id = "mining-paragraph-1">When mining, it's always good to have a mine. To make one, dig down, but not straight down, to about y position 15
                (You can use "show coordinates" in settings). That's where <span class = "diamond">diamond</span> starts to generate. Start mining.
            Later on, when you have a lot of <span class = "stone">stone</span>, go back up, and make like WAY TOO MANY torches, and a lot of 
        stone pickaxes too. Then, just go back down to your mine, and start mining like crazy. When all your pickaxes break,
        You should maybe have some iron, so then, go back up and make an iron pickaxe. With that, you can start mining gold,
    <span class = "diamond">diamond</span>, and <span class = "redstone">redstone</span>. With those, you can make more tools(but not <span class = "redstone">redstone</span>). Later, you can dig all the way down 
        to bedrock, which is the unbreakable material at the bottom of <span class = "MINECRAFT">minecraft</span>. It's usually at about y position -59.
        Start making long tunnels about 3 blocks above it. Just make straight tunnels, 2 blocks high, 1 block wide. If 
        you want, you can also make some passages, branching off the main passage. Make those smaller tunnels about 2 blocks
        apart.  
            </p>
            <p>When you have very few <span class = "stone">iron</span> or <span class = "diamond">diamond</span> tools, make sure you mine 
                <span class = "stone">stone</span> with stone pickaxes. Otherwise, your <span class = "stone">iron</span>
                and <span class = "diamond">diamond</span> could break, and then you wouldn't be able to mine 
            <span class = "redstone">redstone</span>, <span class = "gold">gold</span>, and <span class = "diamond">diamond. Diamond </span>
                looks like <span class = "stone">stone</span> with blue rectangles in it. <span class = "stone">Iron</span> looks like <span class = "stone">stone</span> with grey
                rectangles in it. <span class = "gold">Gold</span> looks
                like <span class = "stone">stone</span>e with gold rectangles in it. You get the idea. When you mine a lot, you get a LOT of <span class = "stone">stone</span>. Every time you 
                go back up to your house, you should store most of that <span class = "stone">stone</span> in chests, otherwise <span class = "stone">stone</span> could completely cover your
                entire inventory, and you wouldn't have enough room for <span class = "stone">stone</span> pickaxes. There's a max of 64 <span class = "stone">stone</span> in one slot, so if you 
                mine, like, WAY too much, you could end up with thousands of <span class = "stone">stone</span>. That would be good for making cool things(see <a href = "#building-heading">Building Ideas</a>)

            <p>There are some very cool things and very essential things that you can build in <span class = "MINECRAFT">minecraft</span>-learn some here!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A house. Houses are probably the most useful things in <span class = "MINECRAFT">minecraft</span>. You could also build a bunker, 
                    but that would be harder to spot. Build a house by making a square with any material (I recommend <span class = "stone">stone</span> 
                    or <span class = "wood">wood planks</span>),
                    and then make walls. Make walls by stacking more materials on top of the square. Make the height three,
                    then fill in the top. When making the roof, always leave a hole, for a trapdoor. Then put ladders on the walls
                    so you can climb up to the hold and go onto the roof. Later, you can add 2nd and 3rd floors, and make your 
                    house really cool, but first start with a basic house.
                </li>
                <li>A bunker. Bunkers are also really useful, because you usually put beds in them, and they're underground.
                    If you make a house, you should still add a bunker, because if your house gets taken over by mobs, you can 
                    run to your bunker. Make a bunker by digging a giant hole. Yeah.
                </li>
                <li>An infinite <span class = "stone">cobblestone</span> generator. These are REALLY cool. You can mine <span class = "stone">cobblestone</span> without even going below the surface!
                    All you have to do is make a bucket, and have a <span class = "diamond">water</span> source, and a <span class = "redstone">
                        lava</span> source. First, dig a 1 block deep hole, and fill it with 
                    <span class = "diamond">water</span>. Then, dig a two block deep hole exactly right next to it, and that will fill with <span class = "diamond">water</span> too.
                    Then, continuing
                    in the same direction, skip one block and dig a one block deep hole after that. Fill that single hole with <span class = "redstone">lava</span>. Then,
                    dig up the block that seperates the <span class = "diamond">water</span> and the <span class = "redstone">lava</span>, and <span class = stone>cobblestone</span> will start to generate. Cover the lava with 
                <span class = "stone">cobblestone</span>, otherwise you could fall in and die. If the <span class = "redstone">lava</span> turns into 
                obsidian, then try again.
                </li>
                <li>A trench. These are useful, but not so cool. Anyway, since mobs just fall into these holes, your house can become
                    mostly mob-proof. All you have to do is dig a 2 block deep, 2 block wide hole around your house. Then you can put 
                    trapdoors over some parts, to walk across. Just remember to open those trapdoors when you aren't walking across, because
                    otherwise, the mobs could also just walk across.
