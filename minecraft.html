        <h2 id = "mining-heading">MINING TECHNIQUES</h2>
        <p id = "mining-paragraph-1">When mining, it's always good to have a mine. To make one, dig down, but not straight down, to about y position 15
            (You can use "show coordinates" in settings). That's where diamond starts to generate. Start mining.
        Later on, when you have a lot of stone, go back up, and make like WAY TOO MANY torches, and a lot of 
    stone pickaxes too. Then, just go back down to your mine, and start mining like crazy. When all your pickaxes break,
    You should maybe have some iron, so then, go back up and make an iron pickaxe. With that, you can start mining gold,
    diamond, and redstone. With those, you can make more tools(but not redstone). Later, you can dig all the way down 
    to bedrock, which is the unbreakable material at the bottom of minecraft. It's usually at about y position -59.
    Start making long tunnels about 3 blocks above it. Just make straight tunnels, 2 blocks high, 1 block wide. If 
    you want, you can also make some passages, branching off the main passage. Make those smaller tunnels about 2 blocks
    apart.  
        </p>
        <p>When you have very few iron or diamond tools, make sure you mine stone with stone pickaxes. Otherwise, your iron
            and diamond could break, and then you wouldn't be able to mine redstone, gold, and diamond. Diamond 
            looks like stone with blue rectangles in it. Iron looks like stone with grey rectangles in it. Gold looks
            like stone with gold rectangles in it. You get the idea. When you mine a lot, you get a LOT of stone. Every time you 
            go back up to your house, you should store most of that stone in chests, otherwise stone could completely cover your
            entire inventory, and you wouldn't have enough room for stone pickaxes. There's a max of 64 stone in one slot, so if you 
            mine, like, WAY too much, you could end up with thousands of stone. That would be good for making cool things(see <a href = "#building-heading">Building Ideas</a>)
        </p>
        <h2 id = "building-heading">BUILDING IDEAS</h2>
        <p>There are some very cool things and very essential things that you can build in minecraft-learn some here!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A house. Houses are probably the most useful things in minecraft. You could also build a bunker, 
                but that would be harder to spot. Build a house by making a square with any material (I recommend stone or wood planks),
                and then make walls. Make walls by stacking more materials on top of the square. Make the height three,
                then fill in the top. When making the roof, always leave a hole, for a trapdoor. Then put ladders on the walls
                so you can climb up to the hold and go onto the roof. Later, you can add 2nd and 3rd floors, and make your 
                house really cool, but first start with a basic house.
